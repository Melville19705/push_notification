# push_notification

'''
I created a push notification app using the Python Pushbullet package library. This app allows me to send daily notification tasks to my phone at a specific time using the PythonAnywhere API key in my code. The app saves all the data on the Pushbullet app, making it easy for me to keep track of my tasks and get reminders throughout the day. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and API integration, as well as my ability to create practical applications that improve productivity and organization.
